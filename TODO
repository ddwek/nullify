This is the list of items to add to, modify or remove from the
current version:

* Nothing scheduled by now.

Next is the list of things I tried hard to find a solution over and over
again and I only got "frustrations":

* Fix up calls to XSetStandardProperties() with a valid pixmap to be used
  as the icon of the window.

* Add handling of WM messages to the program in the X main loop,
  especially to call the atexit function and thus perform a well exit.

* Modify configure.ac to write default and user defines to a config header,
  which can later be #include'd by src/main.c

If you got the answer to any of them, just let me know by writing me to
<todovirtual15@gmail.com>. Your collaboration will be very appreciated!
