	0.3.2 Release
	* configure.ac: updated package version to 0.3.2

	* src/main.c: back to 0.3.0 changes because
	  update_turn() screwed it up on v0.3.1. This
	  only means that new unit tests must to be
	  performed, with graphical testing when needed.

	  computation for the last card to play.

2019-10-15  Daniel Dwek  <todovirtual15@gmail.com>

	0.3.0 Release
	* New file doc/nullify.6: game's manpage automatically
	  generated by "xmlto" and distributed by default for
	  systems which don't have such a tool.

	* New file doc/nullify.xml: XML DocBook of the game.

	* src/main.c: main() gets default settings from the
	  config file /usr/local/share/nullify/res/nullify.conf

	* src/misc.c: New functions dict_get_value() and
	  parse_conf_file().

	* New file res/nullify.conf: It contains the default values
	  of many global variables.

	* src/replay.c: Added support for session file validating.

	* src/main.c: main() writes the DTD header on saved logs.

	* New file res/nullify.dtd: Added Document Type Definition
	  (a.k.a., DTD) for this game.

	* src/main.c: do_exit() now saves the log in the user's home
	  directory by default (i.e., if --savelog is given).

	* src/misc.c: new function expand_tilde().

	* New command line options: "--replay-file", "--replay-hand",
	  and "--list-hands".

	* New file src/replay.c: Added support for replaying old
	  saved games.

	0.2.1 Release
	* Reset special points to 0 at the beginning of each hand.

	0.2.0 Release
	* Some translation fixes in #defines, variables, function names
	  and filenames living under subdirectory res/.
	
	* Added animate_card() function to animate cards moves from and
	  to the deck.
	
	* Added lock_deck() and unlock_deck() functions to disable/enable
	  human's capability to take cards from the deck.
	
	* Removed the circular animation which was rendered when had no
	  more cards to get from the deck. Instead, do_timer() now
	  displays a subtle vertical bar of colors to the left of the deck.
	
	* Last card of the human's list (the rightmost one) can now be
	  selected when the mouse is within the range of the entire width
	  of a card.
	
	* Added registration of exit function to be executed when the
	  window is closed.
	
	* Added functions to render tables inside dialogues in src/gui.c.
	  They are called from finish_hand() to display players' scores
	  with a new look.
	
	* Added optional support of session logging with XML format in
	  order to help the developers (currently only me) to debug the
	  game. XML is included if the user run the "./configure" script
	  with the "--enable-xml-logs=yes" option on the command line
	  (it requires libxml2 headers and libraries to be present in the
	  system).
	
	* Timers can now be set with functions defined in src/misc.c.
	  The behavior of them is the same as the initial release, but
	  readability was improved.
	
	* One of the most important stages during the development process
	  has been added: testing. Test suites demonstrate the right
	  working of several functions which manage dynamic data structures
	  under normal conditions and worst-case scenarios.
	
	* Bots are smarter than earlier versions: every time they pick up
	  a big number of cards from the deck perform computation based on
	  digraphs in order to determine how many cards they can dispatch
	  in their turns. See main.c:bot_play() or test/digraph_generic.c
	  to know how to implement solutions to your projects using digraphs.
	
	* Added the field .specialpts in the struct @player to keep a
	  counter of the special points that each player can add or
	  subtract to its own scores in the current hand. Players will add
	  1 extra point every time they get six cards from the deck and will
	  subtract 1 point when dispatch at least four cards in their turns.
	
	* Removed subdirectory "cards/". The image of each card is now
	  packed by suits in the subdirectory "res/" (e.g., cards of clubs
	  are grouped in res/suit-clubs.png, etc).
	
	* Added short and long command line options parsing to give to the
	  user a chance to override the default values of many global
	  variables. Type "nullify --help" to get a list of all the
	  configurable settings.
	
	* The message showing the rules of the game when it is run is now
	  loaded from the file "rules.txt" by print_rules() function.
	
	* getcardfromdeck() fixed. See BUGS for more detail.
