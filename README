Nullify
=======

Nullify is a cards game for Linux whose goal is to get rid of all of your cards.
Each game is based on hands (formerly known as rounds) and each hand is based on
turns. The hand ends when there is only one player who could not play all of the
cards in its turns, with the number of them being added to its scores. The game
ends when a player reaches the upper limit of scores allowed (default 16),
becoming on the looser of the game.

Main rule
=========

When in turn, the player must either play a card of the same kind / number as
last card played or pick up one card from the deck. If is not possible play the
new card because it mismatches kind or number, you must to do right-click over
the deck and the turn is updated to the next player.

Special cards
=============

There are some cards with special meanings that modify either the amount of cards that
you can play "in a single shot" or the amount of cards that you _must_ to get from
the deck. The list is as follows:

Ace and two
-----------

  Each time a player dispatches an "A" or "2", the next player in turn will be
  forced to get up to 4 or 2 cards from the deck, respectively. As an exception
  to the rule, if the first card get is another "A" or "2" then the player can choose
  play that card, in which case the total sum of aces and two's played will be the
  amount of cards that the next player must get from the table.

Four and seven
--------------

  Whether a "4" or "7" is played, another card of the same kind / number must be played.

Jack
----

  Likewise, but also the player can select the kind of cards to play.

Queen
-----

  Whether a "Q" is played, the most immediate player in turn is skipped.

King
----

  Whether a "K" is played, the rotation mode is toggled clockwise/counter-clockwise

Have fun ;-)
