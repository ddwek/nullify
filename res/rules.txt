Nullify is a cards game whose goal is to get rid of all the cards you have in hand.

Main rule
=========
When in turn, the player must either play a card of the same suit / number as last
card played or pick up one card from the deck. If is not possible play the new card
because it mismatches suit or number, you must to do right-click over the deck and
the turn is updated to the next player.

Quick reference of special cards (see README for further explanations)
======================================================================
Ace and two:
    Each time a player dispatches an 'A' or '2', the next player in turn will be
    forced to get up to 4 or 2 cards from the deck, respectively.
Four and seven:
    Whether a '4' or '7' is played, another card of the same suit/number must be
    played.
Jack:
    Likewise, but also the player can select the suit of cards to play.
Queen:
    Whether a 'Q' is played, the most immediate player in turn is skipped.
King:
    Whether a 'K' is played, rotation mode is toggled clockwise/counter-clockwise.

Have fun ;-)
