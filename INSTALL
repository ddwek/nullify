Installation
------------

To install using the GNU Build System method, just open a terminal and
type the following commands:

	username@host: dir $ tar -jxf nullify.tar.bz2
	username@host: dir $ cd nullify
	username@host: nullify $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-xml-logs=yes]
	username@host: nullify $ make
	[ become superuser if needed ]
	username@host: nullify $ make install-strip

Option "--enable-xml-logs=yes" adds built-in support of session dumping to
XML files, useful if you are debugging the game or reporting bugs (you should include
your session file in the latter case).
