Installation
------------

To install using the GNU Build System method, just open a terminal and
type the following commands:

	username@host: dir $ tar -jxf nullify.tar.bz2
	username@host: dir $ cd nullify
	username@host: nullify $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-xml-logs=yes]
	username@host: nullify $ make
	[ become superuser if needed ]
	username@host: nullify $ make install-strip

Option "--enable-xml-logs=yes" adds built-in support of session dumping to
XML files, useful if you are debugging the game or reporting bugs (you should include
your session file in the latter case).

XML support requires libxml2 headers and libs to be present on the system.
Regardless of the latter, in all of the cases nullify depends on libX11,
libpng and librt to compile and link.
